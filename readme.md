# BlackJack Game

The next of the ProgrammingExpert.io projects...implementing a the card game blackjack using Python! I'm excited for this project, no doubt it will be a challenge but I think it will give me a great opportunity to practice with some OOP concepts as well as implementing longer/more complex programs in general!

I will try and add to this readme as I progress throughout the project. Here we go!
