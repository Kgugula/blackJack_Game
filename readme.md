# BlackJack Game

The next of the ProgrammingExpert.io projects...implementing a the card game blackjack using Python! I'm excited for this project, no doubt it will be a challenge but I think it will give me a great opportunity to practice with some OOP concepts as well as implementing longer/more complex programs in general!

I will try and add to this readme as I progress throughout the project. Here we go!

## Day 2 ##

I'm moving along on this project, my last commit was pushing starter code. To be candid I'm finding this fairly difficult - mainly because of all the classes/scripts involved. This is my first time working with multiple scripts. I can see how it should help with code readability and debugging...but for now it's just causing a bit of a headache. I'm only using one 10.5' display! Yikes. 

I think it will help to redo a mindmap I created when yesterday when setting out on this project. I'm getting stuck on the granular stuff i.e. create a while loop to prompt user to do this, test out, debug, repeat. While what I think is a much better use of time is to connect all the classes and implement standalone code blocks at a time. 

Mutability is also a question that keeps popping into my head. With the use of mainly lists, it's getting touger to make sure my newly formed lists aren't effecting the old. I'm going to circle back and see where I can put some tuples, or maybe sets since the 'order' of a hand isn't an issue.

And now the real fun begins...implementing the logic behind the game, when does the dealer hit, how to get the value of a hand, what value will an ACE be in a given hand!?! Right now if you ran the main.py script you would make it to the point in the game where you and the dealer are both dealt two cards, and those cards are displayed on the user interface, with the second dealer card being displayed as 'Unknown'.
